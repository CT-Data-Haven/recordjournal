## Preferred language by age and ethnicity

Younger people really don’t seem to like *just* Spanish language

Generally speaking, respondents who identify as Latino don’t prefer
English language only content.

## News sources

Preferred sources is also an open text field. Mining for word clouds…

By age, young people put fewer answers in, older people put a lot more
