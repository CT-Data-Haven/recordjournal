Local news generally more popular than farther-out regions. Also note that one person wrote in Puerto Rico for the geographical question.

```{r echo = F}
response_geos %>%
  filter(!is.na(share)) %>% 
  filter(geo %in% c("Local", "State", "Regional", "National", "International")) %>% 
  mutate(geo = as.factor(geo),
         geo = fct_relevel(geo, "Local", "State", "Regional", "National", "International")) %>%

  geom_col(width = .8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(share, accuracy = 1)), vjust = 1.2) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(survey), switch = "y") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +

Over and under 40 for the English language survey have the same top 5 or so topics of interest with Education, Music/Arts/Culture, and Health topping the lists.

```{r fig.height=6}
response_topic %>% 
  filter(survey == "English", n >= 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = share, y = reorder(topic, share))) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(share, accuracy = 1)), hjust = 1.1) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(age)) +
  labs(title = "Topics of interest by age, English survey respondents", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

Health and Education top the list for Spanish survey respondents in both age groups. For younger people, the next three are Sports, Politics, and Music/Arts/Culture. For older people it's Sports, Music/Arts/Culture, and Local Events.

```{r fig.height=6}
response_topic %>% 
  filter(survey == "Spanish", n >= 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = share, y = reorder(topic, share))) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(share, accuracy = 1)), hjust = 1.1) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(age)) +
  labs(title = "Topics of interest by age, Spanish survey respondents", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

## Special topics

```{r}
eng_special_topic <- tibble(topic = c(str_split(read_english$Q4, ";(?=[A-Z])", simplify = T)),
                    survey = "English") %>% 
  mutate(topic = str_remove(topic, "Topics related to "))
spn_special_topic <- tibble(topic = c(str_split(read_spanish$Q4, ";(?=[A-Z])", simplify = T)),
                    survey = "Spanish") %>% 
  mutate(topic = str_remove(topic, "Temas acerca de "))

response_special_topic <- bind_rows(eng_special_topic, spn_special_topic) %>%
  filter(topic != "") %>% 
  mutate(topic = str_to_sentence(topic)) %>% 
  mutate(topic = if_else(grepl("Familias", topic), "Families with children", topic),
         topic = if_else(grepl("Propietarios", topic), "Small business owners", topic),
         topic = if_else(grepl("edad", topic), "Seniors", topic),
         topic = if_else(grepl("Los", topic), "Teens", topic),
         topic = if_else(grepl("JÃ³venes|adolescentes", topic), "Young adults", topic),
         topic = if_else(grepl("Participacion", topic), "Community engagement", topic)) %>%
  filter(!topic %in% c("None of these", "No", "Ninguno de estos")) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("subscribe", topic)) %>% 
  tabyl(topic, survey) %>% 
  add_row(topic = "Total", English = 482, Spanish  = 630) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = English:Spanish, names_to = "survey", values_to = "value") %>% 
  group_by(survey) %>% 
  calc_shares(group = topic, denom = "Total", value = value)
```

Special topic areas being primarily focused on families makes sense with who we're surveying and how we're collecting responses.

```{r}
response_special_topic %>% 
  filter(value > 1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(share)) %>% 
  mutate(topic = as.factor(topic),
         topic = fct_rev(topic)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = share, y = reorder(topic, share))) +
  geom_col(width = .8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(share, accuracy = 1)), hjust = 1.2) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(survey)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(y = "Topics relevant to...", x = NULL, title = "Share of respondents by special topic area")
```
