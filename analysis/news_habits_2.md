News Topics & Areas of Interest
================

## Geographic scope

More than half of respondents who speak Spanish at home are interested
in international news. Local, state, and international levels are
generally of the most interest.

## Topics

This list is really long, so breaking it out by category for four
graphics.

Among all respondents, education and health still top the list. There
are many, many write-ins here that I will share separately.

Iâ€™m really surprised such a small share of young people selected
environment/climate change. Music/arts/culture, education, and sports
top the list for young people. Health, education, and music/arts/culture
for the other two groups.

Looks like people who speak English at home also have an interest in
local events, otherwise health, education, and music top the lists
still, but Spanish-speakers also like to read about sports.

Same general trends with sports ranking a bit higher among foreign-born
Latinos.

## Special topics

No surprises in the ages 30-49 group wanting stories about families with
kids/youth and respondents ages 50+ wanting stories about seniors.
