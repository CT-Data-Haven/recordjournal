Respondent demographics

Current number of respondents (blanks removed) as of November 8, 2022.

**I’m going to stop disaggregating by survey type so we can focus on
disaggregating by other metrics, like age, gender, or nationality**

## Age

![](demographics_files/figure-gfm/age-1.png)<!-- -->

This time around, I’ll group ages into 0-29, 30-49, and 50+

## Gender x age

Across all age groups, more women than men responding, with greatest
disparity in 30-49 range. Keep that in mind as we look at these
age-based breakdowns later.

**Also we are now HEAVILY skewed towards middle-aged women**

| gender           |   n |
|:-----------------|----:|
| Woman            | 963 |
| Man              | 635 |
| NA               |  19 |
| Opt out          |   7 |
| Transgender & NB |   7 |
