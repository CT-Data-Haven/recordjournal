Respondent demographics
================

Current number of respondents (blanks removed) as of November 8, 2022.

| survey  |    n |
|:--------|-----:|
| English |  747 |
| Spanish |  884 |
| Total   | 1631 |

**I’m going to stop disaggregating by survey type so we can focus on
disaggregating by other metrics, like age, gender, or nationality**

## Age

![](demographics_files/figure-gfm/age-1.png)<!-- -->

This time around, I’ll group ages into 0-29, 30-49, and 50+

## Gender x age

Across all age groups, more women than men responding, with greatest
disparity in 30-49 range. Keep that in mind as we look at these
age-based breakdowns later.

**Also we are now HEAVILY skewed towards middle-aged women**

| gender           |   n | share |
|:-----------------|----:|:------|
| Woman            | 963 | 60%   |
| Man              | 635 | 39%   |
| NA               |  19 | 1%    |
| Opt out          |   7 | 0%    |
| Transgender & NB |   7 | 0%    |

## Ethnicity x gender x age

Slightly lower shares of older adults identifying as Latino

## Place of birth x age

Younger and older people more likely to be born in the US/PR. I am
surprised at the diversity in the 30-49 crowd.

| place_of_birth     |   n | share |
|:-------------------|----:|:------|
| DOMINICAN REPUBLIC |  65 | 4%    |
| ECUADOR            | 172 | 11%   |
| MEXICO             | 209 | 13%   |
| OTHER              | 277 | 17%   |
| PUERTO RICO        | 358 | 22%   |
| USA                | 550 | 34%   |

## Language spoken at home x age

Pretty even language split among older adults.

| language                 |   n | share |
|:-------------------------|----:|:------|
| Both English and Spanish | 683 | 43%   |
| English                  | 379 | 24%   |
| Spanish                  | 511 | 32%   |

## Internet-enabled devices and internet at home x age

I’m kind of shocked at the under-30 lack of device/internet, but not at
the notable increase in lack of internet in older age groups; lack of
device corresponds with lack of internet.

## Registered voter x age x gender

This is pretty typical nationwide.

## Other demographic details

Unsurprisingly, half of the students are younger people, middle aged
adults have kids under 18. Few business owners.
