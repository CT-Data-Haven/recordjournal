Respondent demographics
================

Current number of respondents (blanks removed) as of November 8, 2022.

**I’m going to stop disaggregating by survey type so we can focus on
disaggregating by other metrics, like age, gender, or nationality**

| survey  | responses |
|:--------|----------:|
| English |       755 |
| Spanish |       893 |
| Total   |      1648 |

# Demographics

### Age

This time around, I’ll group ages into 0-29, 30-49, and 50+

### Gender x age

Across all age groups, more women than men responding, with greatest
disparity in 30-49 range. Keep that in mind as we look at these
age-based breakdowns later.
