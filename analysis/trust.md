Trust in news media
================

## Trustworthiness by source by group

Local news tops the trustworthiness list among all age groups. Older
adults are more skeptical of social media/social circles. I wonder if
that’s related to whether or not they even use those sources.

Latinos trust social media news at more than twice the rate of
non-Latinos. Again local news tops the list, but Latinos also trust
national news sources (Telemundo, etc.) at a higher rate than
non-Latinos. Again, like social media among older people, I wonder if
it’s that non-Latinos tend to prefer local news.

Similar trend in people who speak Spanish or both languages at home–
greater trust in national news sources. People who speak English at home
generally distrust social media more.

## Beliefs

Most older adults believe the news covers important topics and they
trust the sources of news they get, but there’s a lot of ambivalence
about whether news reflects their values, although a plurality of older
adults agree with that. We see this in our DCWS survey data, too… older
adults just think more stuff is relevant to them.

No real dissimilarities here. These probably trend towards general
totals.

People who speak Spanish at home are more likely to agree that local
news reflects their beliefs. I wonder if this is influenced by the fact
people are answering this survey for their local paper.
